"""
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. 
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
(Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
